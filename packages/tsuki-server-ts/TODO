Todos:
  Explore the option of using JWT or Cookie base authentication, I am probably leaning towards using JWT,
  for authentication mostly for the fact of already having prior experience in implementing.

  Core Auth Functionality:
    ☐ Press Cmd/Ctrl+Enter to add a new todo
    ☐ Users can sign up for to the app with a unique email
    ☐ Users cannot sign up for to the app with a duplicate email
    ☐ Users can login to the app with valid email/password
    ☐ Users cannot login to the app with a blank or missing email
    ☐ Users cannot login to the app with a blank or incorrect password
    ☐ There is a resource that can only be seen by logged in users
    ☐ There is a resource that can only be seen by a specific user
    ☐ There is a resource that has some links and content that only appears when logged in / for certain users
  Authentication Security:
    ☐ Password is hashed in the database using a slow-hashing algorithm @critical 
    ☐ JWT is sent with `Authentication` header @high
    ☐ Encryption keys are set in environment variables @critical 
  Authentiaction:
    ☐ Add auth router
    ☐ Create user with POST /auth/register
      ☐ validate required fields
      ☐ Check if email is unique
      ☐ hash password with bcrypt
      ☐ insert into db
    ☐ Login user with POST /auth/login
      ☐ check if email in db
      ☐ compare password with hashed password in db
